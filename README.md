#The process of my study

As a CS student, I am not smart. Thus I should put more effort on studing. To prove my ability, I attend a exam PAT on June 8th. And I want to get more than 80 scores. These are my todo list

*Learning data structures
*Learning algorithms to pass the exam
*Do more algorithm questions to get better score on my PAT test

I will update the process of my study on this document.
